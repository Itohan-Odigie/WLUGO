        Welcome to WLUGO!

WLUGO is your go-to course exploration platform, crafted specifically for the students at Wilfrid Laurier University. Our aim is straightforward: we provide a platform for honest, unfiltered feedback on courses and instructors.

Ever had a less-than-stellar lecture? Share your story. Encountered an inspiring professor? We’re all ears. Stumbled upon a course that didn’t meet your expectations? Your review could be a beacon for your peers.

Our pledge is to bolster the decision-making of over 30,000 students each month with real experiences to guide their course selections, steering them towards the gems and away from the duds.

Our Story

Conceived as a Capstone Project by four passionate students from the Computer Science program, WLUGO was born to fill a critical void: accessible, comprehensive information about university courses. Since our launch in 2012, we’ve become a vital tool in course planning.

Here’s a thought from Alex Tremblay, one of our founders, about the course selection process before WLUGO:

"Choosing courses was like solving a complex puzzle without seeing the big picture. The official course listings were overwhelming and lacked firsthand student insights. Our peers' advice was invaluable, yet sporadic and hard to gather."

Curious for more? Dive into our blog for the full story of how four students turned a bold concept into a thriving reality.

2019 marked the advent of WLUGO 2.0, introducing a sleeker interface, faster performance, and new features focused on what students truly value. While we’ve evolved technologically, our dedication to the Laurier student body remains unwavering.

Warm regards,

The WLUGO Team
